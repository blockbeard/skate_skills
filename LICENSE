The rest of the work, mostly the contents of the "theme-showcase" div and the skate_skills.js file are all rights reserved Chris Wilson. I will probably open source them at some point, but I haven't decided whether I'm going to try and make a few quid selling a mobile app, so I don't really know what to do with them yet.
Please don't steal it, if you want to help out or it's been ages since I've touched it then get hold of me and we can probably work something out.
