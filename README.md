# Skate Skills
When I've been practicing roller skating skills on my own I found a couple of problems. One of them is that it is easy to just practice what you are already good at. The other one is that when you get tested on your skills, or even just when you need to use them you don't know what is coming or when. When I practice I think, OK, I'll do a transition, so I get set up to do a transition then do it when I'm ready. I wanted something that would say "do a transition now" and I would just have to do it.
