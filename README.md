# basic_bootstrap_template
A basic template with the minimum bootstrap components included.
Based on the "Bootstrap theme" example with all of the displayed components with the exception of the top navbar commented out so they don't display but are easily available for use. 
# Files
Includes the basic bootstrap files plus the minimum components to make it work.
template.html remains as a generic template. index.html is customised with my details.
